# Privacy Policy for My Clients

Effective Date: February 5, 2025

This Privacy Policy outlines how your personal data is collected, used, and protected when using the "My Clients" app. By using this app, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy.

## 1. Data Collection

"My Clients" is a locally-based appointment management app that allows you to store and manage appointments directly on your device. All data related to appointments is stored locally on your device and is not sent to external servers. However, we do provide iCloud backup functionality for your data, which is backed up by Apple's services.

### iCloud Backup
If you choose to use the iCloud backup feature, your data may be stored and backed up through Apple’s iCloud service. iCloud backups are encrypted and stored by Apple according to their privacy practices.

### Third-Party SDKs
"My Clients" includes the following third-party services:

- **Applovin SDK**: Used to display advertisements within the app. This may collect certain data for ad personalization. For more information, refer to the [Applovin Privacy Policy](https://www.applovin.com/privacy/).
- **Google AdMob SDK**: Used to display advertisements within the app. This may collect personal information for the purpose of ad targeting. For more information, refer to the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
- **Firebase Analytics**: Used for app analytics to understand how users interact with the app. Firebase Analytics does not collect personal information. For more details, refer to the [Firebase Privacy Policy](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy).
- **RevenueCat SDK**: Used for handling in-app subscriptions and purchases. It may collect data related to your purchases. For more information, refer to the [RevenueCat Privacy Policy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy).

## 2. Data Usage

We do not collect personal information unless explicitly provided by you (e.g., via iCloud backup). The app uses third-party SDKs for the purpose of displaying ads and analytics to improve the app experience. These SDKs may collect data for purposes such as personalized advertising, analytics, and in-app purchases.

### Purpose of Data Collection
- To provide in-app ads (via Applovin SDK and Google AdMob SDK).
- To track app usage for analytics (via Firebase Analytics).
- To facilitate in-app purchases and subscriptions (via RevenueCat SDK).
- To back up data to iCloud (if enabled by the user).

## 3. Data Sharing

We do not share your personal data with any third parties, except where required by law or as explained in this policy with the third-party SDKs mentioned above. The third-party services integrated into the app may collect and use data as outlined in their respective privacy policies.

## 4. Data Retention

We do not store any personal data in the app itself. If you choose to back up your data using iCloud, your data will be stored according to Apple's iCloud storage policies. The third-party SDKs may store data as required for the purposes of their services (e.g., ads, analytics, in-app purchases).

## 5. Your Choices

You can manage your data and privacy preferences by:
- Disabling iCloud backup if you do not wish to back up your data to Apple’s cloud services.
- Adjusting your device’s privacy settings to control ad personalization.
- Disabling or limiting the use of third-party SDKs by changing your device's settings.

## 6. Security

We take reasonable steps to protect your data. However, please note that no method of data transmission or storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee the security of any data transmitted to or from the app.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post the revised Privacy Policy on this page with an updated effective date. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how your data is being protected.
